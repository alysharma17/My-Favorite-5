        <h2> Health</h2>
            <p id="texthealth">Persians have hereditary health issues that can be a concern. They include polycystic kidney disease (PKD), progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), bladder stones, cystitis (bladder infections), and liver shunts. Responsible breeders take steps to avoid these problems. They can live from 12-17 years.</p>

        <h2> Personality</h2>
            <p id="personalitypersians"> The dignified and docile Persian cat is known for being quiet and sweet. Although Persians tend to be relaxed and easygoing, they also command an air of royalty. They may not be quick to hiss or scratch, but that doesn't mean they won't become annoyed when bothered by loud children or pets.</p>
